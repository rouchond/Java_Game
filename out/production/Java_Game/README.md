# Java Game/Game Engine

This is going to be built for platformers. While this will be a game, 
there will be a game engine (though probably not fully fleshed out) 
implemented as well.

The goal is to have the engine pieces very well documented, and the game
parts hopefully well documented as well? The game piece isn't my main goal.



## Main features

- Level Editor
- Audio Handler
- Animation Handler
- State Machine??
